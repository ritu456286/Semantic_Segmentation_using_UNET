# Semantic Segmentation using with U-Net

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to use U-Net for automating nucleus detection as part of the 2018 Data Science Bowl. The goal is to facilitate faster research into various diseases by improving nucleus detection accuracy in cell images.

## Project Description

The Jupyter Notebook in this repository provides a detailed implementation of U-Net for semantic segmentation of cell nuclei. The notebook walks through the process of combining mask images, training the U-Net model, and performing nucleus detection on test images.
